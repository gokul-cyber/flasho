- [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) - (if you want to add packages to the backend)

### Setup the project
The project is a monorepo, meaning that it is a collection of multiple packages managed in the same repository.

-  Start with [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) Flasho's [repository](https://github.com/flashohq/flasho). Clone or download your fork to your local machine.
After cloning your fork,

#### 1. Backend Server

- Install all the python dependencies
  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the backend server

```jsx
uvicorn --reload app.api:app
```

#### 2. Frontend

```jsx
cd web-app && yarn
```
```jsx
yarn dev
```

#### To access the backend and frontend run
```jsx
nginx
```

You can access the apps in 
1. Frontend @ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
1. Backend @ [http://localhost:8080/api/](https://localhost:8080/api/)


## Coding guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please keep these rules in mind as you are working:
1. All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
2. We use [Eslint Rule Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/), with minor changes. An automated formatter is available using prettier.
3. We use [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for the python formatting.
